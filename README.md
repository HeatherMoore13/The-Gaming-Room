The client, The Gaming Room, would like their game, Draw It or Lose It, to develop a web-basd version of the gaming application. The client has no concept on how to set up this environment and has requested our involvement. 
The software requiremments are:
 -expand across multiple platforms
- have the ability to have one or more teams invilved
- multiple players will be assigned to each team
- game and team names must be unique; and check availibility
- one instance can exist in the menory at any goven time
- be able to manage large image files
- scale thousands of players
- market their consumer base
- stay within budget
- increase revenue

While developing this documantation, I feel that my strength was in the recommendations.I cgave a detail account for each section. While working through the design documnet to develop the code for the web-based application, 
learning about the constraints, memory and storage helped me process my code more effectively by analyzing the different platoformd and what they have that will aid in the 
success of the application. If given the option to revise the document, I would chose the evaluation section. I could have given an indepth description
of each section, so the client could better understand my findings. 
While developing software design we need to kee the end user in mind. After all the end user is where the revenue will generate from
and if they are at risk while using the software that makes the company as well as the developer liable. It is the developers job to keep the end user
free from security risks as well as privacy matters.
I had to acquire the requirememnts form my client, evaluate what language I was going to use and how I was going to 
develop my OPP, instances, which platform would meet all requirements including memory and storage, as well as take into accountability the clinet's consumer base may have limitations on device availibility, so we had to make it work for all platforms. 
In future development I would use the same techinques and strategies I have for theis development but do more research.
